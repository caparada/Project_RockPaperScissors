    "Rock, paper, scissors is a two-player hand motion game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the player is going to play against the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To play rock, paper, and scissors, each player counts until three, shakes the fist and uses the hand to make the symbol of a rock, paper or scissors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rock**: represented by a closed fist\n",
    "- **paper**: represented by a open hand (palm)\n",
    "- **scissors**: represented by 2 fingers\n",
    "\n",
    "![rock, paper, and scissors hand symbols](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/rock-scissors-paper-hand-gesture-260nw-689530327.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules of the game:\n",
    "- **Rock** (fist) smashes scissors (two fingers) - Rock wins!\n",
    "- **Paper** (palm) wraps rock (fist) - Paper wins!\n",
    "- **Scissors** (two fingers) cut paper (palm) - Scissors win!\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='green'>*Note:\n",
    "This is a 3-round game.\n",

    "The game will display the winner after each round. At the end of all 3 rounds, the game will display the final winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player will then have the chance to play again or quit the game.*</font>"

    "\n",
    "**Set up:**\n",
    "- I imported the random module for the generation of random computer input.\n",
    "- I declared variables to store player input, computer input, and player score.\n",
    "- I created functions for the following actions:\n",
    "     - get_choices(): to get player and computer inputs. It also checks if the player input is correct.\n",
    "     - win_checker(): to determine the winner/round.\n",
    "     - rockPaperScissors(): to call the game.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Gameplay loop:**\n",
    "- I used a while loop to keep the game running until the player decides to quit.\n",
    "- Inside the loop:\n",
    "     - I display the game rules.\n",
    "     - I invite the player to make the 1st throw and start the game.\n",
    "     - I call the function get_choices() function to get player input.\n",
    "     - The get_choices() function checks if the player input is correct.\n",
    "     - The get_choices() function also imports the random module to get random computer input.\n",
    "     - I call the win_checker() function to handle different player choices and determine the winner/round\n",
    "     - I use a for loop to make the game play 3 times consecutively (3 rounds).\n",
    "     - I get the total score at the end of 3 rounds.\n",
    "     - Determine the final winner.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**End game**\n",
    "- I display congratulatory message or loss message based on the final game state.\n",
    "- I offer the option to play again or exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The function rockPaperScissors()**\n",
    "- I created a function named rockPaperScissors() to allow the player to simply type rockPaperScissors() in the console and start playing!\n",
